# Fiolin Developer Documentation

TODO: Write the documentation

For now, just refer to the comments in the [types][types] file or take a look
at some [example fiolin scripts][examples]. You want to create a valid json
file following the `FiolinScript` interface. Once you've created the json file,
upload it to a github pages site.
