A not-necessarily-exhaustive list of TODOs:
- Documentation
  - Landing page copy
- Dev server and release:
  - Get unjs/nitro#2814 merged/released and then revert my local changes.
  - Set up tests involving the web server(s) and playwright to check that the
    security properties hold.
  - HSTS for prod? Any updates to headers for wasm files?
- Core functionality
  - Some kind of flag parsing functionality
  - Get some other emscripten binary working in the same file-system as pyodide.
    (xpdf? imagemagick?)
  - Some kind of (interactive?) canvas functionality
  - More file-conversion example scripts
    - SVG recolor
    - Extracting text and tables from PDFs
    - ImageMagick:
      - Resize / adjust quality of / trim image
      - View or strip EXIF / other metadata
      - Make ICOs
      - Make thumbnails
      - Montage, append
      - Combine into GIF / explode out from GIF
      - Make background transparent
      - To grayscale, invert, change colorspace, tint, blur
      - Mirror or rotate
      - Image to PDF
      - Convert formats

- Frontend
  - Improve the "simple" file UI to allow for resetting and redownloading.
  - Advanced UI options other than the "simple" version.
  - Lower UI perceived latency (e.g., with installPkgs and queuing run actions)
    without allowing RUN to be posted to worker when it's not ready.
  - Autocomplete search for landing page.
  - Appropriate modal warnings for 3p + localstorage memory of approvals
  - Ability to edit script metadata in the editor and a json-generator button
