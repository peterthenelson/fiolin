This is very partial; I have a running notes google doc that has more stuff, but
these are more concrete programming tasks:

- Get unjs/nitro#2814 merged/released and then revert my local changes to nitro
- Make a ppt-unlocking script that actually works w/in the setup.
- Get some other emscripten binary working in the same file-system as pyodide.
- Set up tests involving the web server(s) and selenium or something along those
  lines to check that the security properties hold.
