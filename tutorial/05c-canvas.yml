  title: 5b. Advanced UI -- Canvas
  author: Peter Nelson
  description: >
    Forms can include canvas elements that can be drawn on or images displayed
    on. Use `fiolin.get_canvas()` to get a canvas by name. Note that if your
    script is running outside of the web browser (as may be the case in a test),
    this will return None regardless of whether such a canvas is specified in
    the form.
