    The inputAccept attribute can be used to configure the file chooser to only
    show files of a particular type (e.g., .jpg) or a whole category of types
    (e.g., image/*). See
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept for
    more details on unique file type specifiers.
