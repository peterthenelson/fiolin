  title: 3e. Basic UI -- Terminal Mode
  author: Peter Nelson
  description: >
    So far, the pane displaying output from the program has acted much like a
    command-line terminal, showing interleaved text from stdout and stderr. The
    terminal can be configured in other ways.
interface:
  inputFiles: NONE
  outputFiles: NONE
  # TODO: Change this and see how it affects things
  terminal: LOG
runtime: {}
