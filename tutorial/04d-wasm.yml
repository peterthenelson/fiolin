    You can configure fiolin to install some pre-selected WASM modules. This
    currently is limited to imagemagick, although there are some issues around
    js/py interop that may need to be ironed out. See
    https://github.com/dlemstra/magick-wasm for details on how the js api works.
    Note that the python file-system is mounted under /py in the imagemagick
    file-system.
